<h3 style="color:blue">What is CSS?</h3>
<p>Cascading Style Sheets (<strong style="color:blue">CSS</strong>) is <u>a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.</u>
<br><center><image src="css image.jpg"width="350"></center></body>
<strong style="color:blue">CSS</strong> is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
<br><strong style="color:blue">CSS</strong> is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
<br>This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics
<br>; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant <strong style="color:blue">CSS</strong> in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
<br>repetition in the structural content; and enable the .<strong style="color:blue">CSS</strong> file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
<br>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods,
<br>such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. <strong style="color:blue">CSS</strong> also has rules for
<br>alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
<br>The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element.
<br>This cascading priority scheme is predictable.
