<br><strong style="color:green">JavaScript</strong> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated JS, is <u>a programming language</u>
<br>that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use
<br><strong style="color:green">JavaScript</strong> on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.
<br><br> All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
<br><strong style="color:green">JavaScript</strong> is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms
<br>It has application programming interfaces(APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions,
<br>standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
<br>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities.
<br>In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides <strong style="color:green">JavaScript</strong> APIs for I/O.
<br><strong style="color:green">JavaScript</strong> engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core
<br>components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.
